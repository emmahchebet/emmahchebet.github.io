I'm a passionate about Networking and Cybersecurity which entails securing networks from intruders, misuse, or data breaches.
I have a background in Applied Computing and majored in Information Secuiryt and Forensic thus my goal is to be a Cyberseurity Expert and be able to prevent and identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

I believe that my learning and the skills I have,can contribute to a productive outcome.
