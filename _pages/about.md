I'm a passionate about Networking and Cybersecurity which entails securing networks from intruders, misuse, or data breaches.
I have a background in Applied Computing and majored in Information Secuiryt and Forensic thus my goal is to be a Cyberseurity Expert and be able to prevent and identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

I believe that my learning and the skills I have,can contribute to a productive outcome.

# About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm **[Your Name]**, an aspiring cybersecurity and network professional passionate about protecting systems and data in our increasingly connected world.

With a strong foundation in computer networking and a growing skill set in cybersecurity, I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and security. My interests include network design, secure configurations, and learning how to detect and prevent cyber threats.

I’m currently expanding my knowledge in areas like:

- Network protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP)
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Firewalls and access control
- VPNs and secure remote access
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing

I believe in the importance of strong digital defense and aim to contribute to building secure, resilient networks. Whether it's configuring routers and switches, or analyzing potential vulnerabilities, I enjoy solving problems and learning through hands-on practice.

When I’m not diving into labs or learning tools like Wireshark and Cisco Packet Tracer, you might find me exploring new tech, reading about cybersecurity trends, or working on certification goals.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or chat about security and tech!
